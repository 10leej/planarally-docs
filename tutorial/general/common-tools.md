# Common tools

PlanarAlly packs a bunch of tools for your convenience.
Some of these are used often throughout a session, some are more exotic.

For a detailled explanation of most tools, visit the [tools section](/docs/tools/select/).

## Toolbar and mode

Most tools can be found in the bottomright on the 'toolbar'.
Simply clicking on the various names will open the tool and might even open some additional UI to interact with.

At the end of the toolbar in a different colour is the "mode switcher".
Because not all tools are needed at the same time, the concept of a toolbar mode was introduced and currently consists of two modes: "Play" and "Build". The idea is that most tools in Play mode are relevant during normal play, whereas the build mode tools are more relevant to the DM during prep, but can also sometimes be whipped out during active play.

You can freely swap between these two at any time by clicking on the mode switcher or using the `tab` keybinding.

Some tools are only available in a certain mode, and some tools are available in both but with some extra functionality depending on the mode.

## The camera - pan + zoom

Before interacting with our characters, it's always good to get a feel for how to move the camera around.

The primary interaction with the camera are the pan and zoom tools.

### Pan

The pan tool is one of the dedicated tools available in the toolbar.
When selected you can simply press your left mouse button and drag the screen around.

You can also pan by holding down the middle mouse button!

### Zoom

The zoom tool is not part of the toolbar but is a separate UI element in the topright.
When using the zoom tool it will always zoom in relation to the center of the screen.

This in contrast to using the other way to zoom: the scrollwheel.
This will always zoom in relation to where your mouse cursor is.

### Other

Although pan and zoom are your bread and butter, there are some other things that will change the camera location that are more advanced features, but we'll briefly mention them.

Pressing `space` will center the screen on your token\* or if you have multiple tokens, it will cycle through them.

Pressing `ctrl+0` or `numpad 5` will center the screen on the (0, 0) origin.

[Markers](/docs/player/markers) allow you to jump to a certain token immediately from the sidemenu.

_**\*token** has a very specific meaning in the context of PlanarAlly [See terminology](/docs/terminology/)._
