# In-game Settings

The in-game settings are accessible from the side menu (click the <font-awesome :icon="['fas', 'cog']"/>-icon on the upper left screen of your browser window to open the menu).

As a player, there are a couple of things you can configure.

## Snapping Behaviour

When checked, this inverts the default [snapping behaviour](/docs/player/snapping/).

## Grid Size

Because players can be using different screens (e.g. a projector, a laptop, a 4k tv), the default grid size of 1 grid cell == 50px might not be interesting. This setting allows players to modify the amount of pixels are used to render a single grid cell.

## Colour Styles

You can configure which colours you desire for your [ruler](/docs/tools/ruler/), the grid and the fog of war.
The opacity slider for the FOW colour is non functional, the DM can adjust this to their personal preference in the [DM settings](/docs/dm/settings/#fow-opacity).

## Language

Last, but not least, you can select another language by choosing one of the supported languages in the drop-down menu.
Note that PlanarAlly is developed in english and, thus, in case a translation of something in the user-interface is missing, the english version of the string will be displayed.
