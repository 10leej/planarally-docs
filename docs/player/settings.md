# In-game Settings

The in-game settings are accessible from the side menu (click the <font-awesome :icon="['fas', 'cog']"/>-icon on the upper left screen of your browser window to open the menu).

In-game Settings are divided in two groups, allowing you to configure the *appearance* and *behaviour* of PlanarAlly.

## Appearance

### Language

Here, you can choose a different language to be displayed in the user interface.
This will replicate to all other campaigns you play or run, just as if done through the [dashboard](/docs/dashboard/#localisation).

### Grid

The colour setting defines in what colour the [grid layer](docs/dm/layers/#grid) (i.e. the grid lines) will be drawn upon the [map layer](/docs/dm/layers/#map).

The grid size setting is private to each client.
It affects only scale to take into account that the default grid size of 1 grid cell equalling 50px, square, will look very different on different screens (e.g. a laptop, a 4k TV or a projector).

### Ruler

Here, the colour of the [ruler](docs/tools/ruler) as displayed in the client can be set.
If the ruler is used publicly, all other players will see the ruler used in this client with the colour defined here.

### Fog

Short for 'fog of war', this setting allows to configure how everything unseen to the client's token(s) shall be covered.

## Behavior

### Snapping

When checked, this inverts the default [snapping behaviour](/docs/player/snapping/).

### Mouse & Gestures

Here, the *scroll to zoom* functionality can be disabled.
This might be helpful for users of touch-input devices.
