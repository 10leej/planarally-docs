# Game Board

This is Planar Ally's heart.
When gaming, you will mostly interact with the game board, moving tokens over a map that shows (or does not show) your character's surroundings and other PC and NPC around them.

## Overview

The game board consists of several *layers* that are drawn on top of each other.
PlanarAlly calls a complete set of these layers a *floor*.
Floors can be stacked vertically atop of each other.
A set of floors is called a *location*.
Locations are, if you want, sets of floors that are stacked horizontally.

As a player, you won't be able to see all layers and you won't be able to interact with all layers you see.
Also, you might not be able to see all floors and you might not be able to enter floors you can see.
You will also only *see* one location at a time.

The layers are introduced below with the functionality relevant for players.
They are documented in-depth with also DM-only functionaltiy [within an own page in the DM-section of this documentation](/docs/dm/layers/).

## Locations

Everything you read about up to this point, the layers and floors, together make up a *location*.
As a player, you cannot interact with any other location than the one you're present at.
See the [DM documentation on locations](/docs/dm/locations/) for more information.
