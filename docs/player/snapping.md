# Snapping

_This is a short section on something that you will encounter and want to be aware of!_

Many elements in PlanarAlly have some form of snapping behaviour. This can be snapping to the grid, snapping to existing points etc.

Snapping can be disabled by pressing the `alt` modifier during the relevant operation.
However, because not all people like this behaviour and don't want to have to press an extra key everytime,
there is an option to invert the behaviour in the client settings.

## Examples

When drawing a polygon, every point clicked will try to snap to a nearby grid point or to an existing point.

When resizing a point, it will try to snap to a grid point or existing point.

When rotating a shape, the rotation will snap to multiples of 45 degrees.
