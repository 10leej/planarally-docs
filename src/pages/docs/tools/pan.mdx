# Pan Tool

The Pan tool can be accessed in the toolbar on the bottom right of the screen, regardless of [mode](/docs/tools-overview/#toolbar-and-modes).
When this tool is selected you can dag the screen around when you hold down your mouse while moving it.

## Quick pan

Because pan is such a commonly used action, swapping away other tools can be annoying.

PA also triggers pan on middleclick drag as well as right click drag.
