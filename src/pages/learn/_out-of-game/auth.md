# Authentication

The first page you're greeted with when you visit PlanarAlly will show you a carousel with some of the features of PA as well as a sidebar with a login prompt and an option to register instead.

During registration you can optionally fill in an email address, do note however that it is currently not required for sign-up,
which means that there is no solid recovery mechanism in case you lose your password, so make sure you don't lose it ;) that said it is technically possible for the passwords to be changed by a [server administrator](/docs/server/management). That said there is no automated system so your results may vary.

_! Any account created is unique to that specific PlanarAlly site and will not exist yet (or even be occupied) on another PlanarAlly site._

In the topleft of the login sidebar there is a <font-awesome icon="language" /> icon which when pressed allows you to change the language of the user interface.
Note that PlanarAlly is developed in English and, thus, in case a translation of something in the user-interface is missing in the chosen language, the english version of the string will be displayed as a fallback.
