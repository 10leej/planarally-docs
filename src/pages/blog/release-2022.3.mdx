I promised more regular updates and I failed miserably at that, but hey here is a new release!

_Server owners: changes to the server startup have been made, check [Server](#server)_

## UI changes

### Dashboard redesign

We had a dashboard redesign in 0.26 (March 2021), but here we are again :D

The games section has been collapsed from 3 navigation entries (run/play/create) to just one section.
Additionally the "details" sidebar we had previously took up a lot of space on devices with less screen space.
This section has now been reworked to have most of those options being available when clicking on a game in the list.

Also important to mention is that this time around the asset manager actually has been included in the redesign.
So this hopefully makes some people happy, as the previous iteration was something else :D

### Toolbar icons

Another visual change is that the toolbar now comes with icons instead of labels.

There is a user-setting to change this back to labels if you don't like this.

<Image
    src="/docs/toolbar-example.png"
    width={450}
    aspectRatio={492 / 143}
    alt="Example of the toolbar of a GM in 'Build' mode with the Select tool active and the mode ready to be changed into Play mode, while the filter tool can be used, but not the vision tool."
/>

## QoL

A bunch of quality of life changes were added.

### Panning

It was already possible to pan with the middlemouse, now the right click mouse will also initiate panning-mode while dragging.

This is mostly to improve the experience for people using a touchpad where middlemouse click is less trivial.

### Return to Content

To help people who get lost on the infinite canvas,
a new UI element will popup on the bottom to get you back to the closest content you _can_ see.

This will take into account the vision mode of the campaign (e.g. fog-of-war and line-of-sight).

### Behaviour reminders

The draw tool and vision tool, will now have an orange background colour when they have altered behaviour.
This should grab your attention when you changed something and later forget about it.

For the vision tool, it will highlight at any time you don't have all the tokens active.

For the draw tool, it will highlight the logic and/or the vision tabs when something there is active.

### Complex tracker expression support

When using trackers a life-saver is using the quick selection info to quickly modify trackers during play.
Up until now though, you were limited to a single number and could add a `+` or a `-` at the front to make it relative to the original value.

Starting with this release that interface has been modified to support complexer expressions.
About any math expression (backed by math.js) should now be supported.

It now also has 2 modes: absolute and relative mode. Where the latter adds the outcome of the expression to the original value.

There is also a new client setting to choose which mode is selected by default when you launch a game.

Some examples:

If your tracker has a value of 50 and you run the following expression:

`-(10 + 20 + 5 * 2) + sqrt(4)`

In absolute mode the tracker will now be `-38`, in relative mode it will now be `12` (`50-38`)

Similarly starting from 50 again:

`12`

In absolute mode will become `12` and in relative mode `62` (`50+12`)

### Vision tool - private auras

When deselecting a shape in the vision tool, their private auras would still show up.

## DM: Players

### Client Rectangles

The DM has an option to see the viewport for specific players in the DM settings.

When a player is logged in multiple times (i.e. different clients), this viewport would always follow the client that had the most recent movement.
Which is not exactly great. Now it will instead show a viewport rectangle for each individual client that a player is logged in with.

### Active Players

The left sidebar will now also have a Players section for the DM that lists all connected players.
Clicking on a name in this list will center your view on their current viewport.

Truth be told this is a sort of temporary setup as I would like to integrate it in the UI in a nicer way,
but given my track record it might be there longer then I hope.

## Performance

Some performance improvements were added.

### Shape center calculation

The center of a Shape is used in a lot of places and was calculated on the fly everytime it was needed.

Now the center will be calculated once and remembered, until some action would cause the center to change (e.g. the shape moved) at which point it would be recalculated again.

Most shapes do not change center (e.g. walls) so this _should_ in theory improve performance.

### Sectors

When rendering the scene, for each layer, only shapes visible in the screen are taken into account.
Up until now this was done by iterating through the shapes and doing a visibleInCanvas check.

New in this release is that shapes are ordered in sectors (or chunks) and only the sectors that are in view are checked.

This might be something that will require some further finetuning.

## Server

### Alternate asset files location

It is now possible to change the location of the asset files folder, from which all assets are served.

### Server startup

To manage the server a bit easier, files have been re-organized.
This impacts the server startup, you should now call the `planarally.py` file instead of the `planarserver.py` file.

It accepts the same parameters etc that the original script accepted.

The docker image has been modified, so if you use that you don't have to change anything.

## Bugs

### Shape logic fixes

-   Teleport zone not properly triggering when initiated as a player
-   Teleport zone not properly landing in the center of the target
-   Player door toggles not syncing to the server/persisting
-   Door/Tp area preview not changing floors

### Trackers/Auras

-   Shared trackers/auras not showing up in selection info
-   Shared trackers/auras removal not showing in client until refresh

### Initiative

Since a technical change in 2022.1, the initiative system has been misbehaving when unknown shapes were present for the client.
Unknown shapes can be caused by any number of reasons (e.g. shape has moved to another location, shape is on the DM layer and thus not known to a player, ...).

Some of the below entries are related to the above described issue, which has now been resolved, but some entries are a separate issue entirely.

-   Server should detect client errors in initiative listings better and reject wrong data
-   Modification of the initiative should retain the current active actor under more circumstances
-   Removal of shape caused some initiative inconsistencies
-   Changing between DM layer and player visible layer would trip up initiative sometimes
-   Initiative camera-lock not changing floors

### Assets

-   [DM] Assets not being able to moved up to parent folder
-   [DM] Assets not being removable if a shape with a link to the asset exists
-   [DM|server] The asset manager was no longer useable when using a subpath setup

### Misc

-   Errors in prompt modals were not visible
-   Annotation visible info not syncing to other clients until refresh (UI only)
-   Player state clearing on location change
-   Zoom sensitivity on touchpad
-   Typo in location menu
-   In-game AssetPicker modal UI fixes
-   Prompt modal not clearing error message properly
-   Tool details not always being in the correct location (e.g. when changing mode)
-   Trim down noisy whitespace in selection info
-   Jump to marker not changing floors
-   Moving composite/variant shape to other floor and following would show extra selection boxes
-   Draw layer being rendered below the fog (e.g. rulers/ping etc)
-   Vision not properly recalculating when removing blocking shapes on multifloor setups
-   AssetPicker UI appearing too low
-   Polygon edit UI being left behind when panning
-   [DM] Annotations still being visible until refresh after removing player access
-   [DM] Resetting location specific settings was not immediately synchronizing to clients until a refresh
-   [DM] Enabling fake-player mode would hide the DM entries from the left sidebar
-   [server] Diceroller not working on subpath server
